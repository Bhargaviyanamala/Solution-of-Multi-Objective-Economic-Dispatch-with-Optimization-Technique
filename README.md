This project addresses the Economic Emission Dispatch Problem (EEDP) using the Mother Tree Optimization (MTO) method ,integrating wind energy sources. Wind power uncertainty is modeled using the Weibull distribution, and power balance is maintained through chance-constrained programming (CCP) to ensure system reliability. The MTO method is employed to minimize economic costs and emissions while managing wind power intermittency. A ten-unit system is used to validate the approach, with results compared to other techniques. Additionally, the impact of increased wind power penetration on optimal solutions is analyzed.
